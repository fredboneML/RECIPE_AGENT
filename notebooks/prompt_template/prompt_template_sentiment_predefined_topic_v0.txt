I need to give the sentiment and the topic of a conversation in Dutch. The transcript of the 
conversation is between the <data> XML like tags.

<data>
{{transcript}}
</data>

The sentiment should be a one word sentiment analysis, and 
the topic the topic of the conversation, both in Dutch! The output must be provided in 
JSON format shown in the following example. 

Example output:
{
    "version": 0.0,
    "sentiment": <sentiment>,
    "topic": <topic>,
}


A `topic` must only be one of:
{%- for topic in topics %}
 - `{{topic}}`
{% endfor %}

Write the JSON output and nothing more.

Here is the JSON output:
